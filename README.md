# ivt_rego638
Read registers from IVT Rego638 and send via MQTT &amp; Wifi to Homeassistant

# Todo
1. Build the openhab circuit with a logic gate to act as a buffer for the weak logic signal from the rego6xx.
2. Verify clean logic signal, then the code in this repo should work.
3. Add MQTT to send all sensor and device values to Home Assistant
